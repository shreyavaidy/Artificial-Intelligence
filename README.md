# Artificial-Intelligence

Everything is basically just AI today right? So I had to make a repo with this name. That's all.

But besides the excellent naming, I also added some code I wrote on AI problems and assignments. Shall also try to update with other useful things that I found through my explorations of the inter-webs. Stay-tuned for more commits ;)

* Solving N-puzzle
* Learning to code adversarial search
* 2048 game
* Constraint Satisfaction Problem - a self-solving Sudoku.
* Some Machine Learning algorithms and explorations through scikit-learn
